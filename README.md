# Welcome to the Odoo Sandbox

## Purpose

A temporary repo where we can bang on Odoo and figure out how well it
can work without having to worry about the details of running and
installing the whole shebang.

## Quickstart

_Note: These steps expect that you have Docker running on your computer. Docker
is a nice tool that makes the magic go in Step 3. Please visit
https://www.docker.com/products/docker to get it on your local system._

1. `git clone https://github.com/nation-of-makers/odoo-sandbox.git`
2. `cd odoo-sandbox`
3. `sudo docker-compose up`
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8069/`.
5. Have fun.
